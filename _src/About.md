### Lost in Transaction: A neophyte explores Bitcoin.

Welcome to my Bitcoin blog. I'm a newcomer who's excited by the
potential of Bitcoin. I've got a lot of catching up to do so I'm using
this site to help me learn as much as possible. After all, there's no
better motivation to learn than to expose one's ignorance to the
world! Hopefully, future newcomers will benefit from my dumb
questions though.

I have a computer science background and this will be
programming-oriented blog, but from a Bitcoin beginner's
perspective. I'm a big fan of [Racket](http://racket-lang.org), a
modern dialect of LISP, and I'll be using it to help me learn so there
will occasionally be a Racket-related post.

Thanks for visiting. Feedback, and especially criticism, welcome!
