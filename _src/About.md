### Lost in Transaction: A neophyte explores Bitcoin.

Welcome to my Bitcoin blog! I'm a newcomer who's very excited by the
potential of Bitcoin. I've got a lot of catching up to do so I'm using
this site to help me learn as much as possible. After all, there's no
better motivation to learn than to expose one's ignorance to the
world! Any hopefully, the many future newcomers will benefit from my dumb
questions as well.

I have a computer science background so this blog will sometimes be
technical, but from a Bitcoin beginner's perspective. I'm also a big
fan of [the Racket language](http://racket-lang.org) and I'll be using
it to experiment, so a Racket-related post may occasionally get thrown
into the mix.

Thanks for visiting. And special thanks to those generous enough to
point out when I'm wrong!
