### Lost in Transaction: A beginner explores Bitcoin.

Welcome to my blog. I'm a newcomer who's excited by the potential of
Bitcoin and wants to learn as much as possible. I created this blog to
document my progress. Hopefully, future newcomers can benefit from my
findings.

This will be programming-oriented blog but from a Bitcoin/crypto
beginner's perspective. I'll be using
[Racket](http://racket-lang.org), a LISP descendant, to help me
explore.

Thanks for visiting. Feedback (and criticism!) welcome.
