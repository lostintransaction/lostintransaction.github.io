### Lost in Transaction: A neophyte explores Bitcoin.

Welcome to my Bitcoin blog! I have a computer science background but
I'm completely new to Bitcoin and much of the accompanying crypto
concepts. This site documents my quest to learn as much as possible
about Bitcoin. After all, there's no better motivation to learn than
to expose one's ignorance to the world! If Bitcoin is to succeed,
someone has to ask the dumb questions.

I'm also a big fan of [the Racket language](http://racket-lang.org),
so I'll be using it a lot as I learn.

Thanks for visiting. And special thanks to those generous enough to
tell me when I'm wrong!
