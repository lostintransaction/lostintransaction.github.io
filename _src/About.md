### Lost in Transaction: A neophyte explores Bitcoin.

Welcome to my Bitcoin blog. I'm a newcomer who's excited by the
potential of Bitcoin. I've got a lot of catching up to do so I'm using
this site to help me learn as much and as quickly as possible. There's
no better motivation to learn than to expose one's ignorance to the
world! Hopefully, future newcomers may benefit from my dumb questions.

I have a computer science background and this will be
programming-oriented blog, but from a Bitcoin/crypto beginner's
perspective. I'm a big fan of [Racket](http://racket-lang.org), a
modern LISP dialect, so I'll be using it to help me learn.

Thanks for visiting. Feedback, and especially criticism, welcome!
