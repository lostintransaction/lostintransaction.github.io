### Lost in Transaction: A neophyte explores Bitcoin.

Welcome to my Bitcoin blog. I'm a newcomer who's excited by the
potential of Bitcoin. I've got a lot of catching up to do so of course
I started a blog and I'm using this site to help me learn as much as
possible. Hopefully, future newcomers may benefit from my dumb
questions.

This will be programming-oriented blog but from a Bitcoin/crypto
beginner's perspective. I'm a big fan of
[Racket](http://racket-lang.org), a modern LISP dialect, so I'll be
using it to help me as I explore.

Thanks for visiting. Feedback (and criticism!) welcome.
