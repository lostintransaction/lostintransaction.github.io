Security is really important when handling bitcoins. One easy
safeguard is to make sure the programs you download are actually what
you think they are using hashes and signatures.

In this post, I essentially follow [the MultiBit tutorial][1]. I'm
using 64-bit Windows 7.

# Verifying Hashes #

Most software you download from the internet should provide a hash
that you can verify to make sure the file was not corrupted or altered. Multibit provides SHA256 hashes [here][2].
